## Guess Number Environment
The game will random some integer, and the Ai will choose the number. If the chosen number is equal to the random number the Ai will get a reward, else the Ai will get punished.

## Guessing Number Algorithm
This game actually doesn't need reinforement learning because you can use something like binary search to guess the number. But I'd like to learn more about reinforement learning(rl), and I think it is interesting to see if the rl will figure the algorithm out.

## Result
After a number of traning, The rl failed to guess the number. Maybe because I don't have a good reward system. I don't really know. But atleast I get to do some projects about rl.
